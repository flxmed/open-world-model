# Open World Model

## Goal
Build a world model of myself as a learning system.
The goal is not advice, but simulation of consequences of actions over time.

## Core Question
What will happen in 2–7 days if I take action X today?

## World Definition
- Time step: 1 day
- System: personal learning and energy dynamics

## Actions
- study_intensity ∈ {0, 1, 2}
- sleep_quality ∈ {0, 1}

## Observations
- study_hours
- fatigue (1–5)
- focus (1–5)
- errors
- mood (1–5)

## Latent State
Not directly observed.
Represents energy, overload, and learning stability.

## Non-goals
- No advice generation
- No text-based reasoning
- No optimization of a single metric

## Known Limitations
- Small data
- Subjective measurements
- Non-stationary system
